# 3D Solar System Simulation with Three.js

A interactive 3D model of our solar system with realistic planet orbits and controls.

## Features

- 🌞 Sun at the center with 8 orbiting planets
- 🎮 Interactive speed controls for each planet
- ⏯️ Pause/resume animation
- 🌗 Light/dark mode toggle
- 🔍 Zoomable and rotatable camera
- ✨ Starry background
- 🪐 Planet information on hover

## How to Run

### Option 1: Quick Start (No Installation)
1. **Download the files**:
   - Right-click [this raw HTML file](https://example.com/solar-system.html) and "Save As"
2. **Open in browser**:
   - Double-click the downloaded HTML file
   - OR drag it into any modern browser window

### Option 2: Local Development
1. **Clone repository** (if available):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system.git
   cd solar-system
   Just open index.html directly in your browser

Controls
Control	Action
Left-click + drag	Rotate view
Right-click + drag	Pan camera
Scroll wheel	Zoom in/out
Sliders	Adjust planet speeds
Pause button	Stop/start animation
Light/Dark button	Toggle color theme

System Requirements
Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

WebGL support (enabled by default in most browsers)

Recommended: Dedicated GPU for best performance

Troubleshooting
If planets don't appear:

Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console)

Ensure you're not blocking CDN content

Try a different browser

For texture issues:

The demo uses colored materials instead of image textures

To add textures, see the commented code sections

Customization
Edit these variables in the code to modify:

Planet sizes (radius values)

Orbit distances

Rotation speeds

Colors


**Key Notes for Users:**
1. The standalone HTML contains all required code - no npm install needed
2. Works offline after downloading
3. For best experience, suggest using Chrome/Firefox
4. Mobile touch controls work but desktop recommended
